# Medicare LDS Connector

## 🔗  Docs
Check out our [docs](https://thetuvaproject.com/) to learn about the project and how you can use it.
<br/><br/>

## 🧰  What does this repo do?
The Medicare LDS Connector is a dbt project that maps raw Medicare LDS claims data to the Tuva claims data model and then builds all of the Tuva data marts.  This connector expects your LDS data to be organized into the tables outlined in the [LDS] data dictionaries](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/LimitedDataSets/StandardAnalyticalFiles).

## ✅  Quickstart Guide

### Step 1: Clone or Fork this Repository
Unlike [the Tuva Project](https://github.com/tuva-health/the_tuva_project), this repo is a dbt project, not a dbt package.  Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.
<br/><br/> 

### Step 2: Import the Tuva Project
Next you need to import the Tuva Project dbt package into the Medicare CCLF Connector dbt project.  For example, using dbt CLI you would `cd` into the directly where you cloned this project to and run `dbt deps` to import the latest version of the Tuva Project.
<br/><br/> 

### Step 3: Configure Input Database and Schema
Next you need to tell dbt where your Medicare LDS source data is located.  Do this using the variables `input_database` and `input_schema` in the `dbt_project.yml` file.  You also need to configure your `profile` in the `dbt_project.yml`.
<br/><br/> 

### Step 4: Run
Now you're ready to run the connector and the Tuva Project.  For example, using dbt CLI you would `cd` to the project root folder in the command line and execute `dbt build`.  Next you're now ready to do claims data analytics!  Check out the [data mart](https://thetuvaproject.com/data-marts/about) in our docs to learn what tables you should query.
