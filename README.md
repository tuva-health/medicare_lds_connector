## üß∞ What does this project do?

This connector is a dbt project that runs the Tuva Project on the Medicare SAF claims data, including mapping raw Medicare SAF claims to the Tuva Claims Data Model (CDM), loading all terminology sets, and running all data marts.

You can read more about Medicare SAF claims data [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/LimitedDataSets/StandardAnalyticalFiles).

## Medicare SAF Data Issues
In this section we catalog important data quality issues present in the Medicare SAF data and how we've accounted for those issues in this connector.  This isn't an exhaustive inventory of every data issue.  Rather, we focus on notable issues that impact downstream analytics in the Tuva Project.

- **Claim From Date:** The Medicare SAF data only includes Claim Thru Date, so we don't have a claim date of service start date.  For inpatient claims we've elected to map admission date to the claim_start_date in the Tuva Claims Data Model.
